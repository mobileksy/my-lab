> This is my personal hacker lab — a living, evolving arsenal of technical tools and experiments.

I’m not just “learning to code”. I’m building a full-stack system of real-world problem-solving skills. This repo is where I prototype, deploy, automate, and publish.

## Lab Structure

### 1. `basic-skill/` — Core Foundations
System setup, Docker environments, CI/CD pipelines, Linux command kits, Git workflows.

- docker/ — Reusable Dockerfile + docker-compose setups  
- linux/ — Shell scripts, remote server configs, common CLI tools  
- gitflow/ — Auto commit tools, hooks, graph optimizers, versioning tricks

### 2. `automation/` — AI & Script Power
Tools that automate boring stuff. AI bots, scripts, data wranglers, and tiny utilities.

- ai-bot/ — OpenAI tools, LangChain playgrounds, mini AI agents  
- file-tools/ — File renamers, converters, text processors  
- chrome-plugins/ — Custom plugins for faster workflows

### 3. `projects/` — Deployable Mini-Products
Actual projects I’m shipping, from MVPs to public-facing tools.

- md-to-pdf/ — Convert Markdown notes into PDFs on the fly  
- knowledge-bot/ — QA assistant powered by custom context + OpenAI  
- web-dashboard/ — Static site frontend with real data visualizations

### 4. `docs/` — Learning Trails
Roadmaps, tech notes, command cheatsheets, and long-term learning logs.

- learning-roadmap.md  
- docker-cheatsheet.md  
- ai-tools-note.md

## My Goal:

> Build for control. Build for leverage. Build for long-term reputation.

Everything here is open, messy, and real. Welcome to my lab — let’s create things that matter.
